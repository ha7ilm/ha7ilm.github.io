I can send you a detailed CV on request. A summary of my skills is available below.

### Software Defined Radio

I have built a web-based spectrum monitoring tool, [OpenWebRX](http://sdr.hu/openwebrx), which is in use at [200+ servers around the world](http://sdr.hu/map). I also implemented CSDR, the DSP tool behind it. CSDR has been used by NASA while tracking the ExoMars EDM lander.

### FPGA development

I have experience with the Xilinx toolchain (Vivado and SDK), and especially the Zynq SoCs.
I have solved timing problems, written bootloaders, wrote TCL scripts and worked around the bugs of the toolchain, etc.
I can implement both the programmable logic and the firmware for the CPU, and the interfaces between them. I can basically make things work for you.
I also have some experience with the Altera/Intel toolchain.

### GPU development

I have experience in accelerating algorithms with both CUDA and OpenCL. 

### SIMD acceleration

I have experience in accelerating algorithms with ARM NEON. [Here](https://github.com/simonyiszk/csdr/blob/master/libcsdr.c#L352) you can find my digital downconverter implementation accelerated with NEON.

### Hardware engineering

I have designed and built PCBs, and brought up the prototypes. 
I have experience with AVR, PIC and ARM-based MCUs and various hardware interfaces.
I also have experience with RF measurements.

### Software development

I have built web, desktop and embedded software.
Usually I'm doing the web/UI graphics design myself as well (including the OpenWebRX website, [SDR.hu](https://sdr.hu)).

### IT security

I have IT security certifications from the EC-Council (Certified Ethical Hacker) and Scademy.
