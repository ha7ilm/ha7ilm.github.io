**Planned date of taking the exam: 2018-09-08**

I have completed a mock exam at [scorenexus.com](scorenexus.com) on 2018-08-04.
My total score was 92 (out of 120), with the following scores in each section:

* reading: 28/30
* listening: 28/30
* speaking: 19/30
* writing: 17/30

> The ScoreNexus mock exam is a simulated TOEFL exam to give an opinion on how someone would perform on a real exam. However, it is NOT an official TOEFL exam.

This score would be OK for some universities I'm currently interested in, but not for all of them. On that reason, I decided to sharpen my skills for some more time, now planning to take the exam on 2018-09-08.
