**Planned date of taking the exam: 2018-08-28**

I have completed a mock exam at [scorenexus.com](scorenexus.com) on 2018-08-04. 

My total score was 92 (out of 120), with the following scores in each section:

* reading: 28/30
* listening: 28/30
* speaking: 19/30
* writing: 17/30

> The ScoreNexus mock exam is a simulated TOEFL exam to give an opinion on how someone would perform on a real exam. However, it is NOT an official TOEFL exam. 

This score would not be sufficient for every university I'm currently interested in, so I decided to sharpen my skills for two more weeks, now planning to take the exam on 2018-08-28.
