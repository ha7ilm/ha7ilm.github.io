<h1>Support my <a href="/projects">work on open source!</a></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 0;"><a href="" class="sdrhu-m-dev">Hire me.</a></h2>Writing code is my profession, and I have already solved problems for several companies.

<h2 style="margin: 0;">Want to integrate OpenWebRX into your product?</h2>OpenWebRX is dual licensed, so that it is available to be built into future commercial transceivers. <a href="" class="sdrhu-m-dev">Contact me</a> about that. If you support me this way, expect me to care about my open source contributors also while doing business.

<h2 style="margin: 0;">Support development directly via PayPal.</h2>I am doing OpenWebRX in my free time, while I am working on other projects to make a living, and also still doing my Master's at the university. OpenWebRX is a dual licensed project, which means that I am keeping the doors open for its use as a part of commercial products later, although I will keep OpenWebRX open (see the previous section). However, it is currently still a hobby project for me, without a company behind it to support the development. If you want to support my work that I give away for free to ham radio operators and SDR enthusiasts, you can donate via PayPal.

Currently I'm working on the following things:

<ul>

<li><strong>GPGPU and FastDDC:</strong> Improving the DDC algorithms and making the first GPGPU accelerated web-based SDR receiver that is open source. I will also document the algorithms for anyone to use them later. See <a href="2016/03/13/recent-work.html">my article for more</a>.

Also added a new goal: frequency labels.</span></center><br /></li>


<li><strong>Digital demodulators:</strong> This year I am going to introduce PSK31 and RTTY digital demodulators into OpenWebRX and csdr. I am going to document these just as I did with other algorithms in <a href="http://openwebrx.org/bsc-thesis.pdf">my BSc thesis</a>.

</ul>

**Thank you for your support!** 

**Important:** I plan to implement all of these features even if I get no donations. On the other hand, I am not providing a service in return of the donations, and I keep the right to choose which features to work on and implement. The donated amounts are not updated automatically, however, I am updating them regularly (2-3 business days).
