While things like this are not the most important in an SDR application, the OpenWebRX UI has been improved with some 3D animations:

<video autoplay controls style="width:100%;">
	<source src="/files/css3d-openwebrx.webm" />
</video>

<br/>
The source of the inspiration was Tamas, who is working on the open source <a href="http://zeronet.io/">ZeroNet</a> (which is a cool project, make sure to check it out).
