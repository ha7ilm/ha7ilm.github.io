title: Weak Signal Propagation Reporter tests
---
I've recently made some experiments with the great WSPR software, which can dig out and process so weak signals that you can't even hear. Along with the software, there's a great web interface on which you can see the contacts on a map.

The software receives and transmits automatically, just don't forget to synchronize your clock and uncheck the IDLE box.

Half an hour after my first attempt to use the software, I was heard from Australia with only 5W output power, and I heard the other station, too:

The bending lines in the spectrum show that the local oscillator's stability in our old Yaesu FT-757 is not too good.
