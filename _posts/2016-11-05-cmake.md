title: "If setting CFLAGS to cmake from command-line does not work"

What happens if you really try to add some CFLAGS to *cmake* from command-line...

	export CFLAGS="-Werror"
	export CXXFLAGS="-Werror"
	cmake ..
	make VERBOSE=1

...but it does not do anything at all?

If you encounter this problem, it is likely that you overwrite CFLAGS somewehere in your `CMakeLists.txt` files.

For example, replace this:

    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-std=c99")

...with the correct one that appends the new flags instead of overwriting them:

    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -std=c99")
