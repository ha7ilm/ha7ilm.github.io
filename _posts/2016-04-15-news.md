After writing my <a href="/2016/03/25/kickstarter.html">previous blog post,</a> John has changed his mind, and he contacted me about resolving the situation. He made a Memorandum of Understanding about Valent F(x) giving a part of the profit of KiwiSDR to me and Andrew Holme (the author of the GPS receiver code used in KiwiSDR).<br/><br/>I would like to say a big thanks to a lot of people, for your amazing support! It was not possible without you!
