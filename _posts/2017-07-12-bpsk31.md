title: "BPSK31 and 3D waterfall diagram in OpenWebRX"

Today I'm happy to announce a new version of OpenWebRX with a **BPSK31 demodulator** built-in.
On the video below, I'm using OpenWebRX with a [HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) to monitor the 20m band and demodulate a BPSK31 QSO:

OpenWebRX now also has a **3D waterfall diagram**, featured in the video below, which in addition also shows how the secondary waterfall diagram of the BPSK31 demodulator can be zoomed by moving the filter edges around:

I'm also happy to say I've just graduated from university, earning a Master's degree in electronic engineering. I'm now looking for new opportunities related to Software Defined Radio. I am also thinking about continuing my studies in this field for PhD degree.

My Master's thesis about **"Integrating digital demodulators into OpenWebRX"** can be [downloaded here](http://openwebrx.org/msc-thesis.pdf). It covers:

* how CSDR can be used to demodulate BPSK31, BPSK63 and RTTY from the command line, and also to derive new digital modes from existing ones by changing to the commands,
* how CSDR can be used as a general purpose FSK/PSK demodulator, demonstrated with decoding FSK signals sent by a [YARD Stick One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/).

On 15 July, I'm going to have a talk about these topics at [SDRA-2017](http://2017.sdra.io/), a conference organized at [HAMRADIO Friedrichshafen](http://www.hamradio-friedrichshafen.de/ham-en/). 

I also have good news about [SDR.hu](http://sdr.hu/): the server has been moved to a DigitalOcean VPS for better reliability.

I'd like to say thanks to everyone who uses OpenWebRX and CSDR, and also everyone who helped me with this project:

* Starting from last February, a lot of people <a href="http://blog.sdr.hu/support">donated</a> to support OpenWebRX development. 
* Mike Ossmann from [Great Scott Gadgets](https://greatscottgadgets.com/) donated a HackRF and a YARD Stick One that I used for development and testing while implementing digital mode support.
* My supervisor, Dr. Péter Horváth taught me a lot about digital signal processing, and he always knew where should I look after the hard to understand topics that I encountered.

Thank you everyone for your support!
