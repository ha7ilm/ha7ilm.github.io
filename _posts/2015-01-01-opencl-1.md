title: OpenCL on Linux Mint 17 and NVIDIA Quadro 1000M

You will need to do something like this (note that I have `xorg-edgers` and you may have to replace 346 with the actual version number):

	sudo apt-get install nvidia-libopencl1-346 nvidia-opencl-icd-346 opencl-headers ocl-icd-opencl-dev ocl-icd-libopencl1

...so you can compile a test program:

	git clone https://github.com/hpc12/tools.git
	cd tools
	make
	./cl-demo 1000000 10
