title: LabVIEW and RTL-SDR interface
---
I've made an interface between the popular RTL-SDR compatible hardware and NI LabVIEW. It's not complete, but just got it working. It's a set of SubVIs that can be used to connect to an `rtl_tcp` server. I've also implemented a WFM demodulator, so I could listen to some FM broadcast in LabVIEW.

During the development, the biggest problem was getting usable sound output - it's really hard to get continous playback with the sound VIs that LabVIEW has, there are issues with the buffering.
