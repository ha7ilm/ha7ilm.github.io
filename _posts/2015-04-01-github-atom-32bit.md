title: Debian package for 32-bit GitHub Atom text editor
layout: post

I've recently had difficulty installing GitHub Atom on my PC as only an *amd64* package was available on the official site. Here I'll provide an i386 build:

<a href="/files/atom-0.188.0-i386.deb" class="button">atom-0.188.0-i386.deb</a>

It looks something like this:

I've tested the package on Linux MINT 16 (which is based on Ubuntu, so that should also work).<br />
License can be found <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f6a59621b856795bc72f40914bb66af34593bd0c/LICENSE.md">over here</a>.
