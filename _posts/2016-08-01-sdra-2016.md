I was invited to talk at <a href="http://sdra-2016.de/">Software Defined Radio Academy 2016</a> at HAM RADIO, Friedrichshafen. I had a talk about my work on <a href="https://github.com/simonyiszk/openwebrx/">OpenWebRX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonyiszk/csdr/">csdr</a> carried out during the last year.

You can check out my talk here (the YouTube video will autoplay in the corner):

The YouTube video can also be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgFto-Oj-uw">here</a> on its own.

I would like to say thanks to Markus, DL8RDS and Michael, DK5HH and all other organizers for their hard work. I again met great people at the conference, and had a great time!

In addition, I am releasing a plugin for <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js</a> (a popular framework for creating rich presentations in HTML5 and Javascript). The <a href="https://github.com/ha7ilm/RevealTalkVideo/">RevealTalkVideo</a> plugin allows you to insert the YouTube video of your talk into the <em>reveal.js</em> presentation.
