title: Possible use of RTL-SDR for amateur radiolocation
---

Having watched Balint Seeber's [SDRDF presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSC4Y8yA-jY), I and HA1OP had some interesting ideas.

## SDRDF

The term SDRDF stands for Software Defined Radio Direction Finding. The system created by Balint has the following main features:

* it uses the so-called pseudo doppler technique for direction finding,
* hardware is USRP and an antenna switch controlled by USRP I/O lines,
* DSP processing is implemented with GNUradio, and he also made a GUI called BorDUF.

For reception he uses four antennas mounted on his car's top. The pseudo-doppler direction finding method would require one antenna to be rotated with about 40,000 RPM (for use on VHF), but the result can be approximated by several antennas placed in a circular form, and switching between them with an antenna switch.

Local authorities use cars equipped with [similar equipment](http://www.dopsys.com/products/series%207000/Mobile.html) to locate faulty equipment causing radio interferences.

The true power of software defined radio shows up concerning that Balint could implement a working direction finding device at home.

## New ideas

As currently our best software defined radios over here are RTL-SDR compatible USB dongles, we've been thinking about using them for pseudo doppler direction finding purposes. The most interesting thing we realized, was the fact that **these receivers are so cheap that we could buy one for each antenna, eliminating the need for an antenna switch.** Actually, it might also be required to run all dongles from the same clock source, so **we could hack them to use a common crystal oscillator unit.**

On short wave, another approach would be doing something similar to the Watson-Watt DF principle: make two perpendicular loops, one attached to the symmetrical I input of RTL2832U chip, and one to the Q input, and using the direct sampling hack to receive frequencies under 14.4 MHz with an RTL-SDR dongle. By comparing the signal levels on the same frequency, we still don't get the exact direction, there's an uncertainity of 180Â° of the transmitter location - but we can define a straight line which the transmitter is located on. Watson-Watt would add a third antenna to solve this problem, but I would just leave this uncertainity to keep things simple. The most interesting part would be **drawing a frequency versus direction graph** under the waterfall diagram! The whole thing would require some changes to the librtlsdr code, but **it would use only one dongle.**

Not sure whether we will put any of this in practice, but sounds a good idea to try.
